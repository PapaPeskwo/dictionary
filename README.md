## Description
This is a simple dictionary app designed for convenient use while reading. You can keep the app running in the background, and whenever you come across a word that you want to look up, simply use the app to get its definition. The app will then save the word and its definition to a CSV file for future reference. This way, you can easily build your own vocabulary list while reading without interrupting your flow.

## Installation

```
pip install pydictionary 
```

If an error is produced, try:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

And if the issue persists, try:
```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/yeahwhat-mc/goslate#egg=goslate
```

## Future Ideas
Be able to save to a CSV by name, for example if you want to have a dictionary for the book you're reading.
